# Keras-DL-Classification

I explore using Keras in order to build deep learning frameworks to classify on the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database Challenge" from Kaggle.

In the notebook, " Pima Diabetes Classifier 1" I build a very basic neural network model to become familiar with the Keras framework and explore the dataset in general.

In the notebook, "Pima Diabetes Classfifier 2" I build on the model from the first notebook, tuning the model hyperparameters in order to optimize the performance of the model for this particular use case.
